### BHC App

I built the BHC App for my church. I built as a side project to hone my skills in Jetpack Compose. I singlehandedly completed the app from wireframing to relase on the Playstore.  Here are the technologies used in building the app

**Jepack Compose** - For the UI
**Kotlin**
**Android Studio** - IDE
**MVVM** Architecture
**Firebase**  - Backend
**Glide** - Image Loading
